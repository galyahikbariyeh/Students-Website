# Students Website
The Student Dashboard is a website built using React.JS, React Hooks, and MUI libraries. It allows users to log in. Upon logging in, a welcome message appears on the dashboard page, including the user's name, the number of students, and the most recent student added. Students can be added through the "Students" page, where they can edit or delete their data. There is also a settings page that allows users to adjust the registration mode (light or dark).

3- useContext --> I used it to share data between pages.
4- useRef --> To auto focus on input when page loads.
5- useReducer --> I used it to manage student data (add, delete, edit).
6- useMemo --> I used it to improve performance when calculating the number of students or the last student added.
7- useCallback --> I used it to pass functions like (handleDelete, handleEdit) statically to children of components.
